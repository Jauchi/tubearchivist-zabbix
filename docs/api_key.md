Open this page on your tubearchivist instance: `tubearchivist.example.com/admin/home/account/add/`

* Mark `is staff`
* Set a random password
    * This should truly be random - you don't need to remember it!
* Name: `zabbix`
* Click `ADD`

Under `Tokens`

* Click `Add Token`
* Pick your `Zabbix` user from before
* Copy the token - you will need it later
